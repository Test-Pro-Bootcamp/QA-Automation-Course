//        - Create a base class for a web elements - BaseElement
//        - Create two classes that inherit from the class above: LinkElement and TextElement
//        - Declare a string variable locator with a value "//*[id='some-id']", so it is in both classes (without duplicating the code)
//        - Implement one simple method click(), so it is in both classes (without duplicating the code)
//        - On a click there should be a message printed to the Console: "clicked on an element"
//        - The statement above is true for a text type of element - you can click on it but nothing will happen really
//        - At the same time when you click on a link - you usually get redirected to some other page, so in this case please print out: "clicked and redirected"
//        - It is a simplified version of a framework structure that we will cover in details when we start Selenium
//        - Now let's run it and see what is going to happen:
//          - declare both elements in Main class
//          - print out both locators, what do you see? which principle is that?
//          - call methods for both elements, which principle is that?
